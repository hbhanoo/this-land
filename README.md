# This Land ~~is~~ ain't Your Land

## Project

I'd love to take the lyrics in this project and record a youtube video with world music contributions from artists from all around the world.

I'm sowing the seeds of the project on github specifically so that I can (easily?) collaborate with others to bring this to fruition.

Read below for a little bit more about the project, as well as how to contribute.


## About
In March 2018, I drove my eight year old daughter from Austin to Big Bend National Park in West Texas in our 1988 VW Vanagon/Westfalia.

On the way back, *This Land Is Your Land* came on my spotify as we drove through the the desert and my eyes welled up with tears.

I grew up outside of the United States, so it's a bit of a curiosity how moved I was by the evocative imagery in the song.

And yet, each time I heard the lyrics, it occurred to me that I didn't like the chorus at all.

I **don't** believe that this land was made for any one of us - we are just visitors on this planet like any of the other animals here. Hence:
> *This land ain't made for you and me*.

And while this song was written as an American song, I think it is a beautiful song for our entire planet. And so in changing the locations from purely American ones to global locations, I think it can be a song about the natural beauty all over our world.

## Contributing

I'm starting with the original lyrics I found on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Land_Is_Your_Land#Original_1940_lyrics), and then checking in two modifications -
1.  change the '*was made for you and me*' to '*ain't made*' in the chorus,
1. to put in some ideas for non-US locations.

But I imagine the song having different world music as well as global locations.

So if you know how to make a suggestion and submit a pull request, do that. If not, [here're some instructions](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/). If that's too complicated, just message me with your suggestions.
